//Question 1
//Create an object called cat.
//Give the object one property called complain. complain's value should be a method (a function) which logs the string "Meow!".

const cat = {
  complain: function () {
    console.log("Meow");
  },

cat.complain();

//Question 2
//Select the h3 from the HTML using the querySelector method and assign it to a variable called heading.
//Change its innerHTML value to "Updated heading".

const heading = document.querySelector("h3");
console.log(heading);

heading.innerHTML = "Updated heading";

//Question 3
//Use the style property on the heading variable from the question above to change its font size to "2em".

heading.style.fontSize = "2em";

//Question 4
//Add a class to the heading variable called subheading.

heading.classList.add("subheading");

//Question 5
//Write code that selects all the p elements on a page and assigns them to a variable called paragraphs.
//Loop through the p elements and change the colour of each to "red".

const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");

//Question 6
//Select the div with a class of results, assign it to a variable called resultsContainer
//and set its inner HTML to be <p>New paragraph</p> and its background colour to be yellow.

const resultsContainer = document.querySelector(".results");

resultsContainer.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

//Question 7
//Create a function that has one parameter called list.
//Inside the function, loop through the list parameter and console log the name property in each object.
//Call the function and pass in the cats variable in the script.js file in the repo.

function listConteiner(list) {
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) console.log(list[i].name);

//Question 8
//Create a function called createCats. The function will have one parameter called cats.
//Inside the function loop through the value passed in as cats and create HTML for each object in the array.
//Wrap each item in a div, each name property in an h5 tag and each age property in a p tag.
//If the age property is missing, it should display “Age unknown” instead.
//Return the HTML from the function.
//Call the function and pass in the cats array as the argument.
//Assign the return value of the function to the innerHTML property of the element on the HTML page with a class of cat-container.

const container = document.querySelector(".cat-container");

let html = "";

function createCats(cats) {
  for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++);
